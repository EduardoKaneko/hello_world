## 2. Control Flow
- Boolean **expressions** are statements that can be either ```True``` or ```False```
- Boolean **variable** is a variable that is set to either ```True``` or ```False```
You can create boolean expressions using relational operators:
- Equals: ```==```
- Not equals: ```!=```
- Greater than: ```>```
- Greater than or equal to: ```>=```
- Less than: ```<```
- Less than or equal to: ```<=```

- ```if``` statements can be used to create control flow in your code.
- ```else``` statements can be used to execute code when the conditions of an if statement are not met.
- ```elif``` statements can be used to build additional checks into your if statements
- ```try``` and except statements can be used to build error control into your code.
